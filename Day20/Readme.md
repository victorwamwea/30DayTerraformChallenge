What I Did Today
Mapped the seven-step application deployment workflow to Terraform, simulated all seven steps end-to-end, set up Terraform Cloud, explored Sentinel policies and the private registry, and documented where the workflows align and diverge.

Seven-Step Walkthrough
Step 1 — Version Control
Code lives in the 30daysof-TerraformChallenge GitHub repository. Main branch is protected — no direct pushes, only merges via pull request.

Key difference: the state file is NOT in Git. It lives in encrypted S3. Committing state exposes sensitive resource attributes and causes conflicts when multiple engineers apply simultaneously.

Step 2 — Run Locally
Changed app_version = "v3" in the module call. Ran plan and saved it:

terraform plan -out=day20.tfplan
Step 3 — Feature Branch
git checkout -b update-app-version-day20
git add day20/
git commit -m "feat(day20): update app response to v3 and simulate seven-step deployment workflow"
git push origin update-app-version-day20
Step 4 — Pull Request
Opened PR with plan output pasted in the description — the infrastructure equivalent of a code diff. Reviewer sees what AWS resources will change without running Terraform.

During review, CodeRabbit identified two valid findings:

Missing crash.log in .gitignore — fixed
No IMDSv2 enforcement on launch template — fixed by adding metadata_options block
Step 5 — Automated Tests
✅ Terraform CI / Validate and Plan    — Successful in 34s
✅ Terraform Tests / Unit Tests        — Successful in 35s
✅ Terraform Tests / Validate and Plan — Successful in 27s
⏭️ Terraform Tests / Integration Tests — Skipped (PR only)
Step 6 — Merge and Release
git tag -a "v1.3.0" -m "Update app response to v3 for Day 20"
git push origin v1.3.0
* [new tag] v1.3.0 -> v1.3.0
After merge, integration tests triggered automatically on main.

Step 7 — Deploy
terraform apply "day20.tfplan"
Apply complete! Resources: 11 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.

Outputs:

alb_dns_name       = "webservers-dev-alb-180723400.eu-north-1.elb.amazonaws.com"
instance_type_used = "t3.micro"
sns_topic_arn      = "arn:aws:sns:eu-north-1:629836545449:webservers-dev-alerts"
curl -s http://webservers-dev-alb-180723400.eu-north-1.elb.amazonaws.com
<h1>Hello from webservers-dev — v3 — ip-172-31-7-216.eu-north-1.compute.internal</h1>
Terraform Plan Output
Full plan from Step 2 — saved to day20.tfplan:

Plan: 11 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.

Changes to Outputs:
  + alb_dns_name       = (known after apply)
  + instance_type_used = "t3.micro"
  + sns_topic_arn      = (known after apply)

Saved the plan to: day20.tfplan
Confirmed exactly what was intended — 11 new resources, v3 in user data, t3.micro instance type. Nothing unexpected. Safe to proceed.

Note: *.tfplan added to .gitignore — plan files contain sensitive resource details and must never be committed to Git.

Terraform Cloud Setup
terraform {
  cloud {
    organization = "sarahcodes"

    workspaces {
      name = "webserver-cluster-dev"
    }
  }
}
Run terraform login to authenticate, then terraform init to migrate state.

What Terraform Cloud provides over S3 backend:

Stores every plan — reviewers see it in the UI without running Terraform
Runs terraform apply in a locked, trusted environment — not on a developer's laptop
Manages AWS credentials centrally — no keys on any developer's machine
Full audit log of every plan and apply with who triggered it
Team access control without managing IAM policies
Variable Configuration
Variable	Type	Sensitive	Why
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID	Environment	✅ Yes	AWS credential — never in .tf files or CI logs
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY	Environment	✅ Yes	AWS credential — never in .tf files or CI logs
cluster_name	Terraform	No	Not sensitive
instance_type	Terraform	No	Not sensitive
environment	Terraform	No	Not sensitive
db_secret_name	Terraform	No	Points to Secrets Manager path, not the secret value
Why sensitive variables must never appear in .tf files or CI logs:

Anyone with read access to the repository can see .tf files. Anyone with access to GitHub Actions logs can see CI output. Terraform Cloud encrypts sensitive variables at rest and never displays them in plan output, apply logs, or the UI. The value is injected into the run environment at execution time and immediately discarded.

Sentinel Policies Lab Takeaway
Sentinel is Terraform Cloud's policy-as-code framework. Rules are enforced before every terraform apply — not after.

Example — require Environment tag on all resources:

import "tfplan/v2" as tfplan

main = rule {
  all tfplan.resource_changes as _, changes {
    changes.change.after.tags["Environment"] is not null
  }
}
If any resource in the plan is missing the Environment tag, the apply is blocked before it runs. No human needs to review every plan manually.

What Sentinel provides that GitHub Actions cannot:

Policies enforced server-side — engineers cannot bypass them
Apply to all workspaces in the organisation automatically
Policy violations block apply, not just warn
Audit log of every policy evaluation
Private Registry
The webserver cluster module is published at: https://github.com/SarahWanjiru/terraform-aws-webserver-cluster

Steps to publish to Terraform Cloud private registry:

Repository already follows naming convention: terraform-aws-webserver-cluster (terraform-<provider>-<name>)
Tag a release:
cd ~/Desktop/terraform-aws-webserver-cluster
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin v1.0.0
Terraform Cloud: Registry → Publish → Module → connect SarahWanjiru/terraform-aws-webserver-cluster
Once published, teams reference it like any public module:

module "webserver_cluster" {
  source  = "app.terraform.io/sarahcodes/webserver-cluster/aws"
  version = "1.0.0"

  cluster_name  = "prod-cluster"
  instance_type = "t3.small"
  min_size      = 3
  max_size      = 10
  environment   = "production"
}
The module source URL format is: app.terraform.io/<org>/<module-name>/<provider>

Note: Publishing was attempted during the challenge but blocked by a browser popup blocker on the GitHub App connection step. The repository, naming convention, and version tag are all correctly set up. The registry connection is the final step.

Private registry vs GitHub URL directly:

GitHub URL	Private Registry
Version pinning	Manual ?ref= tag	Semantic version =
Documentation	README only	Auto-generated from variables/outputs
Discovery	Must know the repo URL	Searchable in Terraform Cloud UI
Access control	GitHub permissions	Terraform Cloud team permissions
Usage tracking	None	Shows which workspaces use which version
Workflow Comparison Table
Step	Application Code	Infrastructure Code	Key Difference
1. Version control	Git for source code	Git for .tf files	State file is NOT in Git
2. Run locally	npm start	terraform plan	Plan shows what will change, not a running app
3. Make changes	Edit source files	Edit .tf files	Changes affect real cloud resources
4. Review	Code diff in PR	Plan output in PR	Reviewer must understand cloud resource implications
5. Automated tests	Unit tests, linting	terraform test, Terratest	Infra tests deploy real resources and cost money
6. Merge and release	Merge + tag	Merge + tag	Module consumers must pin to versions explicitly
7. Deploy	CI/CD pipeline	terraform apply	Apply must run from a trusted, locked environment
Biggest difference — Step 5:

Application unit tests run in milliseconds and cost nothing. Terraform integration tests deploy real AWS infrastructure, take 5-15 minutes, and cost money. You cannot run integration tests on every commit the way you run unit tests.

Chapter 10 Learnings
The seven-step workflow exists because deploying application code without it causes incidents. The same is true for infrastructure code — but the consequences are worse. A bad application deploy might break a feature. A bad terraform apply might destroy a production database.

What breaks when teams skip steps:

Skip Step 2 — apply a plan you have not reviewed. Surprises in production.
Skip Step 4 — no second pair of eyes catches mistakes before they reach AWS.
Skip Step 5 — regressions reach production undetected.
Skip Step 6 — no way to roll back to a known good version.
Skip Step 7 discipline — the plan you reviewed is not the plan you applied.
Challenges and Fixes
Missing crash.log in .gitignore: Adding *.tfplan accidentally removed crash.log. CodeRabbit caught it. Fixed by restoring crash.log alongside crash.*.log.

No IMDSv2 on launch template: Launch template had no metadata_options block — instances vulnerable to SSRF via IMDSv1. Fixed:

metadata_options {
  http_endpoint               = "enabled"
  http_tokens                 = "required"
  http_put_response_hop_limit = 1
}
SNS topic encryption suggestion: CodeRabbit suggested KMS encryption for SNS. Declined — adds $1/month per key and complexity for lab infrastructure. Known gap for real production.

day20.tfplan accidentally staged: git add . from inside the live directory staged the plan file. Fixed by unstaging and adding *.tfplan to .gitignore.
