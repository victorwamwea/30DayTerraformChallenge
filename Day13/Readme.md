Day 13: Managing Sensitive Data Securely in Terraform
What I Did Today
Learned exactly how secrets leak in Terraform configurations and closed every leak path. Created a real secret in AWS Secrets Manager, fetched it at apply time using a data source, marked outputs as sensitive, and proved the secret never appears in code, terminal output, or local files. The state file is stored encrypted in S3 — the last line of defence.

The Three Leak Paths
Leak Path 1 — Hardcoded in .tf files
# VULNERABLE — committed to Git the moment you run git add
resource "aws_db_instance" "example" {
  username = "admin"
  password = "super-secret-password"
}
# SECURE — fetched from Secrets Manager at apply time, never in code
resource "aws_db_instance" "example" {
  username = local.db_credentials["username"]
  password = local.db_credentials["password"]
}
Even if you delete the hardcoded value later, it exists in Git history permanently. git log will always show it.

Leak Path 2 — Variable default values
# VULNERABLE — default value is stored in your .tf file and committed to Git
variable "db_password" {
  default = "super-secret-password"
}
# SECURE — no default, Terraform prompts or reads TF_VAR_db_password
variable "db_password" {
  description = "Database password — set via TF_VAR_db_password, never hardcoded"
  type        = string
  sensitive   = true
  default     = null
}
Leak Path 3 — Plaintext in state file
Even when you handle the first two correctly, Terraform stores sensitive resource attribute values in terraform.tfstate in plaintext. Anyone with read access to the state file can see all your secrets.

This is why remote state with encryption is non-negotiable:

terraform {
  backend "s3" {
    bucket         = "sarahcodes-terraform-state-2026"
    key            = "day13/global/secrets/terraform.tfstate"
    region         = "eu-north-1"
    dynamodb_table = "sarahcodes-terraform-locks"
    encrypt        = true  # AES-256 server-side encryption
  }
}
AWS Secrets Manager Integration
Step 1 — Create the secret manually via CLI (never through Terraform)
aws secretsmanager create-secret \
  --name "day13/db/credentials" \
  --secret-string '{"username":"dbadmin","password":"<your-secure-password>"}' \
  --region eu-north-1
Output:

{
    "ARN": "arn:aws:secretsmanager:eu-north-1:629836545449:secret:day13/db/credentials-NHbtMa",
    "Name": "day13/db/credentials",
    "VersionId": "a22e7f9b-0d0c-4379-89ec-9c9ded4fc35e"
}
Why manually? If Terraform creates the secret, the secret value must exist somewhere in your configuration before Terraform runs — chicken and egg problem. Bootstrap secrets are always created outside Terraform.

Step 2 — Fetch at apply time using data sources
data "aws_secretsmanager_secret" "db_credentials" {
  name = "day13/db/credentials"
}

data "aws_secretsmanager_secret_version" "db_credentials" {
  secret_id = data.aws_secretsmanager_secret.db_credentials.id
}

locals {
  db_credentials = jsondecode(
    data.aws_secretsmanager_secret_version.db_credentials.secret_string
  )
}
jsondecode parses the JSON string into a map so you can access local.db_credentials["username"] and local.db_credentials["password"] individually.

Step 3 — Reference in resources
resource "aws_db_instance" "example" {
  username = local.db_credentials["username"]
  password = local.db_credentials["password"]
}
The secret value never touches your .tf files. It is fetched at runtime.

Sensitive Variable and Output Declarations
variable "db_password" {
  description = "Database password — set via TF_VAR_db_password, never hardcoded"
  type        = string
  sensitive   = true
  default     = null
}

output "db_username_used" {
  description = "The database username fetched from Secrets Manager"
  value       = local.db_credentials["username"]
  sensitive   = true
}
Plan output with sensitive = true:

Changes to Outputs:
  + db_username = (sensitive value)
  + secret_arn  = "arn:aws:secretsmanager:eu-north-1:629836545449:secret:day13/db/credentials-NHbtMa"
Apply output:

Outputs:

db_username = <sensitive>
secret_arn  = "arn:aws:secretsmanager:eu-north-1:629836545449:secret:day13/db/credentials-NHbtMa"
sensitive = true prevents the value from appearing in terminal output and logs. It does NOT prevent the value from being stored in state — the state file still contains the plaintext value. This is why state file encryption is required.

Proof the Secret Is Not in Code
$ grep -r "<your-secure-password>" ~/Desktop/30daysof-TerraformChallenge/day13/
# returns nothing — secret exists nowhere in the codebase

$ grep -r "dbadmin" ~/Desktop/30daysof-TerraformChallenge/day13/live/global/secrets/.terraform/
# returns nothing — not in local terraform files either
The secret lives only in AWS Secrets Manager and in the encrypted S3 state file.

State File Security Audit
Backend configuration:

terraform {
  backend "s3" {
    bucket         = "sarahcodes-terraform-state-2026"
    key            = "day13/global/secrets/terraform.tfstate"
    region         = "eu-north-1"
    dynamodb_table = "sarahcodes-terraform-locks"
    encrypt        = true
  }
}
S3 bucket security checklist:

encrypt = true — AES-256 server-side encryption on all state files
Block all public access — enabled on sarahcodes-terraform-state-2026
Bucket versioning — enabled, allows recovery from accidental overwrites
DynamoDB locking — sarahcodes-terraform-locks prevents concurrent applies
.terraform/ directories not committed — covered by .gitignore
.gitignore
# Terraform providers and plugins
**/.terraform/

# State files — may contain sensitive data in plaintext
*.tfstate
*.tfstate.backup
*.tfstate.lock.info

# Variable files — may contain secrets
*.tfvars
*.tfvars.json
!example.tfvars

# Lock and crash files
.terraform.lock.hcl
crash.log
crash.*.log

# Override files
override.tf
override.tf.json
*_override.tf

# Env vars and secrets
*.env
.env
Why each entry:

.terraform/ — provider binaries, hundreds of MB, no value in Git
*.tfstate — contains plaintext secrets, must never be committed
*.tfvars — often contains real values including secrets
.terraform.lock.hcl — regenerated on init, not needed in Git
*.env — environment variable files often contain credentials
Chapter 6 Learnings
Does sensitive = true prevent secrets from being stored in state?

No. sensitive = true only prevents the value from being printed in terminal output and logs. The value is still stored in plaintext in terraform.tfstate. The state file must be encrypted and access-restricted separately.

HashiCorp Vault vs AWS Secrets Manager — when to use each:

AWS Secrets Manager is the right choice when you are already on AWS and want a managed service with automatic rotation, fine-grained IAM policies, and native integration with RDS, ECS, and Lambda. No infrastructure to manage.

HashiCorp Vault is the right choice when you need secrets management across multiple cloud providers, on-premises infrastructure, or need advanced features like dynamic secrets (credentials that are generated on-demand and expire automatically). Vault requires you to run and maintain the Vault cluster.

Why can you not fully prevent secrets from appearing in state?

Some resource types — like aws_db_instance — store their password attribute in state because Terraform needs to track the current value to detect drift. If the password changes outside Terraform, Terraform needs the old value to know something changed. There is no way to tell Terraform to use a secret without it recording that secret in state.
